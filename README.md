# Angular Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7. It is a really simple Angular app designed to test and understand some of the framework's basic concepts.

## Concepts

The app cover some of the basic concepts including **Component Routing**, **Services** and the **Components** themselves.

There are two simple pages, Home and List:

- **Home:** The Home page is the inicial screen, and it simply covers variable and methods functionality. It has a counter on its class, and a button on the panel that increments its value. Based on the amount of clicks done, some styles and info change in the *html* structure. Yeah I know, not a great deal.
- **List:** The List page uses a HTTPService to fetch breweries data from an open API. When the data is served, the page lists it with the breweries information. Really simple info, just for testing element rendering and iterating over data.

#### This project is entirely based on the [Learn Angular 8 from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TLhUCjY9iA&list=WL&index=10&t=0s) tutorial.
